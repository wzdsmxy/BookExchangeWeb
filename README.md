# Used Book Exchange Website

## Description

University Book Exchange. At the end of each term, many students sell their textbooks to second-hand bookstores to recuperate some of the purchase cost. These stores, in turn, re-sell the used books to students after some mark-up. If students could buy and sell directly to other students, they could cut out the middleman and earn more while spending less.

Write a web application that creates a marketplace for used OSU textbooks. The application should allow students to register their books for sale as well as find books they are interested in buying. With used books, both the price and the condition of the item are important, so both should be reflected in titles for sale (or seeking).
